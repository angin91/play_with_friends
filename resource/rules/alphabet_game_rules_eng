Rules for the Alphabet game

This simple trivia game is surprisingly fun and easy to learn.  The rules are simple.  You get a category like the names of countries or types of animals.  Then, going in turns, each player must name something in that category that matches each letter of the alphabet.

So, if the category was “Fruits”, the first player would need to name a fruit that starts with “A”, like “Apple” or “Apricot”.  The next player would need to answer with a fruit that starts with “B”, like “Banana” or “Blackberries”.  If a player cannot think of a fruit in the category with the current letter, they will be out until the next round.

Random variation: Instead of going in alphabetical order you get a random letter. And you can't say the same word as someone else.
